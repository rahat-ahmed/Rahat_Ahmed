       <h3 style="text-align: justify;">Web designers and web developers are two of the most sought-after professions these days, and it's not as hard as it may seem to become one. With some free time, a keen interest, and a lot of practice and patience, <mark>you could find yourself making world-class websites</mark> and earning a nice income by doing so.There's a very common misunderstanding that Web design is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That's implementation. Web design is design. Learning to weld, machine metal, and mold plastic does not make you a car designer. It is valuable and very common to know how to implement your own designs in code, but it is not the core competence of a designer. Nor is knowing how to use <mark>Illustrator or Photoshop</mark> Those are tools. Tools don't make you a designer.Designers give shape to things. We figure out how stuff should work, then what it should look like. If you want to be a designer, start with visual basics — form, color, typography, contrast, size, and space. Doesn’t matter how you learn. Just learn. Go to school, hit the books, get a mentor. Then work your way up to thinking through how sites should work and be organized to achieve a purpose. That's how you build competence as a designer.</h3>
